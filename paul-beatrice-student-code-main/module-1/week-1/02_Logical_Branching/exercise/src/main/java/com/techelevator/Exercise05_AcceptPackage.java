    All was well until a customer showed up with a 16-foot garden hose laid out straight in a 2x2x194 inch shipping box.
    The package was less than the weight and cubic inches restrictions, but at over 16 feet long,
    it couldn't fit in the van, and they needed to tie it to the roof. So, they added another rule.

    In addition to weighing no more than 40 pounds and not more than four cubic feet,
    no single dimension can be greater than five and a half feet (66 inches) without paying a surcharge.

    Implement the logic to determine if Scamper Shipping accepts a package based on
    the weight, length, width, and height provided, as well as if they've paid the surcharge.

    Examples:
    acceptPackage(20, 36, 24, 12, false) ➔ true (accepts package because weight and volumes are within limits)
	acceptPackage(20, 36, 24, 12, true) ➔ true (accepts package because weight and volumes are within limits even though surcharge is paid)
	acceptPackage(40, 66, 10, 10, false) ➔ true (accepts package because weight and volumes are within limits)
	acceptPackage(40, 67, 10, 10, false) ➔ false (rejects package because one dimension is over 66 inches)
	acceptPackage(40, 67, 10, 10, true) ➔ true (accepts package because surcharge is paid)
	acceptPackage(50, 66, 10, 10, true) ➔ false (rejects package because weight is over 40 pounds, the surcharge does not apply to weight)
