 * The Vue Router is used to "direct" the browser to render a specific view component
 * inside of App.vue depending on the URL.
 *
 * It also is used to detect whether or not a route requires the user to have first authenticated.
 * If the user has not yet authenticated (and needs to) they are redirected to /login
 * If they have (or don't need to) they're allowed to go about their way.
