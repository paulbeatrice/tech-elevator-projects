                    <td>To create the wormhole and black hole, Dr. Kip Thorne collaborated with visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin and his team at Double Negative. Thorne provided pages of deeply sourced Theoretical equations to the team, which then created new CGI software programs based on these equations
                        to create accurate computer simulations of these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, and ultimately the whole CGI program reached up to 800 terabytes of data.
